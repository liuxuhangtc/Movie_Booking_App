## Problem description:
This final project (Movie World App) is to build an iOS application for movie reviews and personal collections. By using Core Data as the database with Swift4, MapKit, and TheMovieDB API.


## Problem Statement:
•	Now days, more and more movies come out on the market which makes us hard to select the right movie to watch without wasting time in the theater for more than 2 hours.
•	Also, people like to discuss all the movies they watched and liked, but sometimes they need something to remind them of the movies they liked or watched before.


## Solution:
•	Therefore, I build an iOS application which allows every user to check the reviews of the movies.
•	Also, customers will be able to create their own movie collections.


## Use cases without login:
•	Homepage will display Top Rate Movies, Upcoming Movies, and Now Playing Movies
•	New users can register and login
•	Also, new users can view movie details and movie reviews
•	And, new users can search the movies by name


## Use cases after login:
•	Users can manage their own information
•	Users can use the map functionality to view the nearby movie theatres
•	Users can use the collection functionality to collect their favorite movies
•	These main functionalities can only be used after register and login.
